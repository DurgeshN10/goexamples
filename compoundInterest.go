// Go Program to calculate Compound Interest
// Write a Go Program to calculate Compound Interest. This golang program allows the user to enter the principal amount, totals years, and interest rates and then find the Compound Interest.

// Future Compound Interest =  principal amount * (1 + interest rates)years
// Compound Interest =  Future Compound Interest â€“ principal amount
